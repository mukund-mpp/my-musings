    "text": "I’ve tried a lot of toothpastes over the years, especially moving between Germany and India. While the general recommendation of “as long as there’s flouride in your toothpaste, anything works” is strictly true, the follwoing breakdown considers mainly the taste, after-taste and how easily it lathers, for my case in particular. Here are my quick thoughts on a few of them, starting with my current go-to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip🏆 Top Recommendation: Aronal\n\n\n\nPrice: €€\nThe mild aftertaste of cloves is the most balanced I’ve ever found in any toothpaste. Combined with its excellent fluoride content and optimal pH level, this is my daily morning go-to.\n\n\n\nOther Noteworthy Mentions\nHere are some of the others I’ve tried, in no particular order:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand\nRating\nPrice\nMy Quick Review\nAvailability\n\n\n\n\nElmex\n★★★★☆\n€€\nThe perfect partner to Aronal for evening use; Easy recommendation due to absolutley no after-tase, which personally I prefer before going to sleep.\nGermany\n\n\nSensodyne\n★★★★☆\n€€\nIf you have sensitive teeth, this is your go-to. Provides noticeable relief.\nGer/India\n\n\nParodontax\n★★★★☆\n€€\nA bit of an acquired salty taste, but excellent for bleeding or sensitive gums.\nGer/India\n\n\nColgate Total\n★★★☆☆\n€\nThe dependable, all-around option you can find anywhere. Does the job well.\nGer/India\n\n\nDabur Red\n★★★☆☆\n€\nA classic Indian herbal choice with a strong, distinct clove and spice flavor.\nIndia\n\n\nPepsodent\n★★★☆☆\n€\nA solid, no-frills alternative to Colgate with a strong minty freshness.\nIndia\n\n\nMeridol\n★★★☆☆\n€€\nAnother German powerhouse for gum issues; feels very gentle on the mouth.\nGermany\n\n\nHimalaya Herbals\n★★★☆☆\n€\nA milder herbal option compared to Dabur Red, good for everyday use.\nIndia\n\n\nVicco Vajradanti\n★★☆☆☆\n€\nA famous Ayurvedic powder-in-a-paste. Unique, but the texture isn’t for everyone.\nIndia\n\n\nWeleda Salt\n★★☆☆☆\n€€€\nA fluoride-free, natural option from Germany. The salty taste is very unique.\nGermany"
